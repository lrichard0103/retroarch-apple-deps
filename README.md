# RetroArch Optional Dependencies for Apple Platforms

Across the three Apple platforms (macOS, iOS, tvOS), RetroArch has
optional dependencies on several libraries. For a platform like Linux,
these would typically be provided by the platform, and checked for at
configure time. The build system for Apple platforms is Xcode and
there is not currently a configure-like phase. Instead they are
provided here, with references back to the source code from which they
were compiled.
